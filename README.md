# HomepageLauncher
Basically will just be a home page for my browser to easily access &amp; launch pages. I plan quite a bit of updates in the future but currently the expectations are to have the following pages: 
<hr>
- Homepage: self-explanatory, this one has my main icons/ sites.<br>
<br>
- YT-DLP command generator<br>
<br>
- QuikLink:Icon generator for this website<br>
<br>
